> More details in https://developer.altdg.com/docs#domain-mapper

This will run all the domains in the provided text file (one per line expected):

python -m adg_api_bulkMapper -e domains sample-domains.txt -k "f816b9125492069f7f2e3b1cc60659f0"
```

`12345` is your ADG API application key. Sign up in https://developer.altdg.com/ to get one!

A CSV output file will be created automatically with the same path as the input file but prepending the current date.

[sample-domains.txt](sample-domains.txt) is a sample list of domains we included in our repo. This file is downloaded as part of this package, no need to re-create it.

### Command arguments (options)

Optional arguments:

* `-e` `--endpoint` Type of mapper. Choices are merchants, domains and products.

* `-o` `--out` Output file path. If not provided, the input file name is used with the ".csv" extension, prepended with the date and time.
* `-F` `--force` When providing a specific out_file, some results may already exist in that file for an input.
                 Use this option to force re-process results that are already in that output file, otherwise existing
                 results won't be processed again. Previous results are NOT overwritten, a new CSV row is added.

```

### Usage as library

You may use `Mapper` class from your python program:

```python
# first, import adg_api_bulkMapper module
import adg_api_bulkMapper

# initialize Mapper class with your key
domain_mapper = adg_api_bulkMapper.Mapper(endpoint='domains', api_key='f816b9125492069f7f2e3b1cc60659f0')

# query API
results = domain_mapper.query_api(['abc.com', 'yahoo.com', 'amazon.com'])
